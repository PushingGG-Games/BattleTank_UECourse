# BattleTank_UECourse
Ben Tristem's Unreal Engine Development Kit Course. Open World tank fighting game

## Main reason to make this
This project is mainly for learning how to program in-depth C++ and to use UDK to it's full potential. 
I want to be able to make a game independently without help and make a name for myself in the gaming industry.

## Why use GitHub
I am using GitHub for this project to both backup my project and to create an online resume for myself.

## Redistribution
Go ahead and use my code for whatever you please, if you pull from it, I wouldn't mind a simple mention on a readme or credits :) but it isn't needed. 

# Thanks!
